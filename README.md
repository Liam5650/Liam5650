# Hey, I'm Liam — a software developer from Toronto. Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I’m a computer science graduate from Toronto Metropolitan University with professional experience in AI code evaluation and a background in systems-oriented programming. During my studies, I focused on areas such as graphics programming, computer vision, machine learning, and game/XR development, which gave me strong foundations in performance-aware and interactive systems.

Since graduating, I’ve been applying these skills through both professional work and personal projects. My recent focus has been on backend and systems development, working with authentication, per-user data ownership, scheduling logic, and code correctness across larger codebases. I’m comfortable analyzing implementation trade-offs, edge cases, and performance considerations.

Notable projects include:
- A [backend-driven spaced repetition system](https://spaced-repetition-api.dev) (live demo) with authentication, per-user data ownership, and SM-2–based review scheduling
- A computer vision and machine learning project that converts sheet music images into structured MIDI data
- Earlier work in game and XR development, including a full VR title and a custom Unity framework for 2D games

You can browse my pinned repositories for both newer backend-focused work and earlier graphics, CV, and game-related projects. Additional game related projects and demos can be found on my website:

I enjoy collaborating, learning from others, and tackling new technical problems. Feel free to reach out via my LinkedIn profile listed in the sidebar.
