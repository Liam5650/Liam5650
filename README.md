## Hey, I'm Liam - a software developer from Toronto. Welcome to my GitHub profile. ðŸ‘‹

I am a computer science graduate from Toronto Metropolitan University, and have always had a deep interest in computer hardware, graphics, and 3D interaction. These interests led me to specializing in game / XR programming and graphics during my studies, as well as taking other courses with a focus on computer-human interaction such as computer vision and machine learning. Since graduating, I have moved on to creating several of my own projects, whether built from the ground up or leveraging modern engines such as Unity and Unreal. A variety of these projects that I have made publically available can be accessed by searching my repositories, or you can find further details along with general project overviews by visiting my website at [https://liam5650.github.io/about.html](https://liam5650.github.io/about.html). I love trying to learn new things and tackling new problems, so please feel free to direct any inquiries to my LinkedIn profile listed in the sidebar. Thank you!
