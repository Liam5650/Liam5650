# Hey, I'm Liam — a software engineer from Toronto, currently living in Tokyo. Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I’m a computer science graduate from Toronto Metropolitan University with professional experience evaluating AI-generated code and a strong background in systems-oriented programming. My earlier work and studies emphasized performance-aware and interactive systems, such as databases, computer networks, machine learning, and graphics programming.

My recent focus has been on backend and systems development, working with authentication, per-user data ownership, scheduling logic, and code correctness across larger codebases. I’m comfortable comparing implementation trade-offs and making performance-aware design decisions.

Notable projects include:
- A **backend-driven spaced repetition system** ([live demo](https://spaced-repetition-api.dev)) featuring authentication, per-user data ownership, and SM-2–based review scheduling
- A **computer vision project** that converts images of sheet music into structured, playable MIDI data
- **Earlier game and XR work**, including a full VR title and a modular Unity framework for 2D games

You can explore my pinned repositories for newer backend-focused projects as well as earlier graphics, computer vision, and game-related work. Additional game and XR projects can be found here: https://liam5650.github.io/

I enjoy collaborating, learning from others, and tackling new technical problems. Feel free to reach out via my LinkedIn profile linked in the sidebar.
